New Features by Release
-----------------------

=== 2.5.0, November, 2012 ===

* Introduce condition estimators for General and Positive Definite cases (xGECON, xPOCON)

* Fix recurring with lapack release number in plasma-installer

* Fix out-of-order computation in QR/LQ factorization that were causing numerical issues with dynamic scheduling

* Fix many comments in the Doxygen documentation

* Correct some performance issues with in-place layout translation

=== 2.4.6, August 20th, 2012 ===

* Add eigenvectors support in eigensolvers for symmetric/hermitian
  problems and generalized problems.

* Add support of Frobenius norm.

* Release the precision generation script used to generate the precision 's', 'd' and 'c' from 'z', as well as 'ds' from 'zc'

* Add all Fortran90 for mixed precision routines.

* Add all Fortran90 wrappers to tile interface and asynchronous
  interface. Thanks to NAG for providing those wrappers.

* Add 4 examples with Fortran90 interface.

* Add support for all computational functions in F77 wrappers.

* Fix memory leaks related to fake dependencies in dynamically scheduled algorithms.

* Fix interface issues in eigensolvers routines.

* Fixed returned info in PLASMA_zgetrf function

* Fixed bug with matrices of size 0.

* WARNING: all lapack interfaces having a T or L argument for QR or LU
  factorization have been changed to take a descriptor. The workspace
  allocation has been changed to match those requirements and all
  functions PLASMA_Alloc_Workspace_XXXXX_Tile are now deprecated and
  users are encouraged to move to the PLASMA_Alloc_Workspace_XXXXX version.

=== 2.4.5, November 22nd, 2011 ===

* Add LU inversion functions: PLASMA_zgetri, PLASMA_zgetri_Tile and
  PLASMA_zgetri_Tile_Async using the recursive parallel panel
  implementation of LU factorization.

* The householder reduction trees for QR and LQ factorizations can now
  work on general cases and not only on matrices with M multiple of MB.

* Matrices generation has been changed in every timing, testing and
  example files to use a parallel initialization generating a better
  distribution of the data on the architecture, especially for Tile
  interface. ``numactl'' is not required anymore.

* Timing routines can now generate DAGs with the --dag option, and
  traces with --trace option if EZTRACE is present.

=== 2.4.2, September 14th, 2011 ===

* New version of quark removing active waiting and allowing user to
  bind tasks to set of cores.

* Installer: Fix compatibility issues between plasma-installer and
  PGI compiler reported on Kraken by A. Bouteiller.

* Fix one memory leak with Hwloc.

* Introduce a new kernel for the recursive LU operation on tile layout
  which reduces cache misses.

* Fix several bugs and introduce new features thanks to people from Fujitsu and NAG :
    - The new LU factorization with partial pivoting introduced in
    release 2.4 is now working on rectangular matrices.
    - Add missing functions to Fortran 77 interface.
    - Add a new Fortran 90 interface to all LAPACK and Tile
    interface. Asynchronous interface and mixed precision routines are
    not available yet.
    - Fix arguments order in header files to fit implementation.

=== 2.4.1, July 8th, 2011 ===

* Fix bug with Fujitsu compiler reported on the forum
  (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=108)

* Unbind threads in PLASMA_Finalize to avoid problem of binding in
  OpenMP section following PLASMA calls (still possible on Mac and AIX
  without hwloc).
  A better fix is to create the OpenMP thread in the user code before
  any call to PLASMA thanks to a fake parallel section.

=== 2.4.0, June 6th, 2011 ===

* Tree-based QR and LQ factorizations: routines for application of the Q matrix support
  all combinations of input parameters: Left/Right, NoTrans/Trans/ConjTrans

* Symmetric Engenvalue Problem using: tile reduction to band-tridiagonal form, reduction
  to "standard" tridiagonal form by bulge chasing, finding eigenvalues using the QR algorithm
  (eigenvectors currently not supported)

* Singular Value Decomposition using: tile reduction to band-bidiagonal form, reduction
  to ``standard'' bidiagonal form by bulge chasing, finding singular values using the QR algorithm
  (singular vectors currently no supported)

* Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting (as opposed to the incremental pivoting in the tile
  LU factorization) and parallel panel (using Quark extensions for nested parallelism)
  WARNING: Following the integration of this new feature, the
  interface to call LU factorization has changed. Now, PLASMA_zgetrf
  follows the LAPACK interface and corresponds to the new partial
  pivoting. Old interface related to LU factorization with incremental
  pivoting is now renamed PLASMA_zgetrf_incpiv.



=== 2.3.1, November 30th, 2010 ===


* Add functions to generate random matrices (plrnt, plghe and plgsy)
  => fix the problem with time_zpotri_tile.c reported by Katayama on the forum
